Writeup for unauthenticated RCE exploit
by @code-byter

==========================

This is a writeup of exploiting the Fantec MWiD25-DS Travel Router (Firmware version: 2.000.030).
This vulnerability allows any unauthorized user to execute arbitrary commands as root user. A vulnerability in the
backup functionality (upload.csp) allows any user to write files and thus reset the user passwords without a valid
session cookie. Using these new credentials the attacker can log into the web interface and exploit a buffer overflow
vulnerability. The SSID parameter of the set wifi client functionality is vulnerable to a heap overflow and allows
the attacker to execute arbitrary terminal commands. The whole exploit is possible without any user input or
required reboot.
